# IBAFlang (Imperative But Also Functional language)
As you may realise from reading the language definition, the language is more I than F. That's why this is just version 0.1 of IBAF. 

This repo contains the projects for IBAF.
- `IBAF-cbs` is the project that contains the source `.cbs` files that defines the language.
- `IBAF-Editor` is the Spoofax project that can be used to build the IDE for IBAF.
- `IBAF-Tests` is a project containing some example programs and the funcon terms they compile to.
